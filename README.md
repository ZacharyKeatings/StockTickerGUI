# StockTickerGUI
A graphical version of Stock Ticker

## Stock Ticker

The object of the game is to buy and sell stocks, and by so doing accumulate a greater amount of money than the other players. The winner is decided by setting a time limit at the start of the game, and is the person having the greatest amount of money when time elapses, after selling his stocks back to the Broker at their final market value.

#### Features:

* You can only switch between the 'Main Menu' and the 'About' page.
* The 'Quit' button closes the program.

#### Project Status:

This is an ongoing project which will be updated as I learn more about Tkinter.
This is a GUI version of the console-based Stock Ticker which can be found in the [Stock-Ticker repo](../Stock-Ticker).

#### To-Do:

* Add main menu
* Add About page
* Add full game functionality
* Add option to save game
* Add option to load game
* Add highscore list organized by number of rounds played
* Add networking option to allow players to play remotely together

#### Inspiration:

This is based on the now out of print board game, Stock Ticker, published by Copp Clark Publishing Company.
