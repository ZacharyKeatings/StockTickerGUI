## Stock Ticker

The object of the game is to buy and sell stocks, and by so doing accumulate a greater amount of money than the other self. The winner is decided by setting a time limit at the start of the game, and is the person having the greatest amount of money when time elapses, after selling his stocks back to the Broker at their final market value.

#### Project Status:

This is an ongoing project which will be updated as I learn more about Tkinter.
